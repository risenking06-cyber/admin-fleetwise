# üîß Final Setup Instructions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Manual Package.json Updates Required

Since I cannot directly modify `package.json`, please add the following manually:

### 1. Add Main Entry Point

Add this line to your `package.json` (at the root level):

```json
{
  "main": "electron/main.js",
  ...other fields
}
```

### 2. Add Scripts

Copy these scripts from `scripts.json` into your `package.json` scripts section:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "electron:dev": "concurrently \"npm run dev\" \"wait-on http://localhost:8080 && cross-env NODE_ENV=development electron .\"",
    "electron:build": "npm run build && electron-builder --win",
    "electron:build:dir": "npm run build && electron-builder --win --dir",
    ...your existing scripts
  }
}
```

### 3. Install Dependencies (if not already installed)

Run:
```bash
npm install
```

This will install all Electron-related dependencies.
